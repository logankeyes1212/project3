Synopsis
This web app is a full stack MERN application.  We use Passport, Materialize, and Amazon web services as our new technologies.  This app is meant to be a suppliment for a user of Fantasy Basketball to assist them in determining their team.


###


Some details of note is we have Passport checking users for authenitication in the state throughout the site and conditionally rendering what the user sees, we deployed as a real website that has a name pointing towards it.  We feature Paralax images that came out very nicely.
